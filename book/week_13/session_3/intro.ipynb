    "In this exercises, you'll be given the location of the [shear force centre](../../external/mechanics-BSc/book/stresses_displacements/cross-sectional/shear-force-centre.md). This topic will be treated in the homework of [next week Wednesday](homework14.2). The only thing you need to know now is that the torsional moment can be calculated using the lever arm with respect to this shear force centre.\n",
